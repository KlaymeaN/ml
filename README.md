# ML
In this repo, I am trying to build some Machine learning algorithms from scratch, just to practice and understand what is happening under the hood, instead of using them as a black box.
## Notebooks
Each notebook has the name of the alrogithm impleneted, with some explanation I tried to write for someone who does not know the subject by heart (ME!).


### References:
The knowledge I have used here, comes mainly from youtube channels of:
- Dr Weinberger
- Andrej Karpathy
Which are easily accesible to almost everyone.
